<p>As we said, learning about ROS is similar to learning about an
automobile. In fact, a car is a lot like a robot (and sometimes it
really is a robot; see the large and active self-driving vehicle
industry). A modern automobile comprises many parts that are
connected to each other. The steering wheel is connected to the front
axle, the brake pedal is connected to the brake calipers, the oxygen
sensor is connected to the fuel injectors, and so on. From this
perspective, a car is a <em>distributed system</em>: each part plays a
well-defined role, communicating (whether electrically or mechanically)
as needed with other parts, and the result of that symphony-like
coordination is a working vehicle.</p>
<p>A key philosophical tenet of ROS is that robotics software should also
be designed and developed as a distributed system. We aim to separate
the functions of a complex system into individual parts that interact
with each other to produce the desired behavior of that system. In ROS
we call those parts <em>nodes</em> and we call the interactions between them
<em>topics</em> (and sometimes <em>services</em>, but we will get to that).</p>
<h2 id="the-ros-communication-graph"><a class="header" href="#the-ros-communication-graph">The ROS Communication Graph</a></h2>
<p>Imagine we are building a wheeled robot that chases a red ball. This
robot needs a camera with which to see the ball, a vision system to
process the camera images to figure out where the ball is, a control
system to decide what direction to move, and some motors
to move the wheels to allow it to move toward the ball. Using ROS we
might construct the system like so:</p>
<p><img src="./images/ros_graph_example.png" alt="image" /></p>
<p>This design separates the software into four ROS <em>nodes</em>: two device
drivers and two algorithms. Those nodes communicate with each other as
shown, via three ROS <em>topics</em>. We call this structure a <em>ROS
communication graph</em>: the nodes are the graph vertices and the topics
are the graph edges. You can tell a lot about a ROS system by examining
its communication graph.</p>
<p>The camera driver node is responsible for handling the details of
interacting with the physical camera, which might happen through a
custom USB protocol, through a vendor-provided library, or in some other
way. Whatever those details, they are encapsulated inside the camera
driver node, which presents a standard <em>topic</em> interface to the rest of
the system. As a result, the blob finder node does not need to know
anything about the camera; it simply receives image data in a standard
format that is used for all cameras in ROS. The output of the blob
finder is the detected location of the red ball, also in a standard
format. Then the target follower node can read in the ball location and
produce the steering direction needed to move toward the ball, again in
a standard format. Finally, the motor driver node's responsibility is to
convert the desired steering direction into the specific instructions
necessary to command the robot's wheel motors accordingly.</p>
<h2 id="publish-subscribe-messaging-topics-and-types"><a class="header" href="#publish-subscribe-messaging-topics-and-types">Publish-Subscribe Messaging: Topics and Types</a></h2>
<p>With the example of the ball-chasing robot in mind, we can add some terminology
to describe what is happening as the system operates. First, the ROS
communication graph is based on a well-known pattern called <em>publish-subscribe
messaging</em>, or simply <em>pub-sub</em>. In a pub-sub system, as the name implies, data
are sent as <em>messages</em> from <em>publishers</em> to <em>subscribers</em>. A publisher may have
zero, one, or multiple subscribers listening to its published messages. Messages
may be published at any time, making the system <em>asynchronous</em>.</p>
<p>In ROS, nodes publish and subscribe via topics, each of which has a name and a
type. A publisher announces that it will be publishing data by <em>advertising</em> a
topic. For example, the camera driver node may advertise a topic named <code>/image</code>
with type <code>sensor_msgs/Image</code>. If the blob finder node subscribes to a topic
with the same name and type, then the two nodes find each other and establish a
connection over which image messages can get from the camera driver to the blob
finder (the nodes find each other and establish those connections in a process
called <em>discovery</em>, which will be covered in detail later in this book). Each
message that flows across the <code>/image</code> topic will be of type
<code>sensor_msgs/Image</code>.</p>
<p>A single node can be (and often is) both a publisher and a subscriber. In our
example, the blob finder subscribes to image messages and publishes ball
location messages. Similarly the target follower subscribes to ball location
messages and publishes steering direction messages.</p>
<p>A topic's type is very important. In fact, taken together, the ROS types are
among the most valuable aspects of the entire platform. First, a type tells you
the syntax: which fields, of which types, does the message contain? Second, it
tells you the semantics: what do those fields mean and how should they be
interpreted? For example, a thermometer and a pressure sensor might produce what
appear to be the same data: a floating-point value. But in ROS, a well-designed
thermometer driver node would publish one clearly defined type (say,
<code>sensor_msgs/Temperature</code>), while a pressure sensor driver node would publish
another (say, <code>sensor_msgs/FluidPressure</code>).</p>
<p>We always advise the use of semantically meaningful message types.
For example, ROS provides simple message types like <code>std_msgs/Float64</code>, which
contains a single 64-bit floating-point field called <code>data</code>. But you should only
use that sort of generic type for rapid prototyping and experimenting. When you
build a real system, even if something like <code>std_msgs/Float64</code> could get the job
done on syntax, you should instead find or define a message that also matches
the semantics of your application.</p>
<h2 id="why-publish-subscribe"><a class="header" href="#why-publish-subscribe">Why Publish-Subscribe?</a></h2>
<p>Given that it comes with additional complexity (nodes, topics, types, etc.), it
is reasonable to ask why ROS follows the pub-sub pattern. After more than a
decade of building and deploying ROS-based robot systems, we can identify
several key benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Substitution</strong>: If we decide to upgrade the robot's camera, we need
only modify or replace the camera driver node. The rest of the system
never knew the details of the camera anyway. Similarly, if we find a
better blob finder node, then we can just swap it in for the old one and
nothing else changes.</li>
<li><strong>Reuse</strong>: A well-designed blob finder node can be used today on this
robot to chase the red ball, then reused tomorrow on a different robot
to chase an orange cat, and so on. Each new use of a node should require only
configuration (no code) changes.</li>
<li><strong>Collaboration</strong>: By cleanly separating concerns between nodes, we
let our blob finder expert do their work independently of the target
follower expert, with neither of them bothering the device driver
expert. It is often the case that a robot application requires the
combined expertise of many people, and it would be difficult to
overstate the importance of ensuring that they can each contribute
confidently and efficiently.</li>
<li><strong>Introspection</strong>: Because the nodes are explicitly communicating with
each other via topics, we can listen in. So when the robot fails to
chase the red ball, and we think that the problem is in the blob finder,
we can use developer tools to visualize, log, and play back that node's
inputs and outputs. The ability to introspect a running system in this
way is instrumental to being able to debug it.</li>
<li><strong>Fault tolerance</strong>: Say that the target follower node crashes because
of a bug. If it is running in its own process, then that crash will
not bring down the rest of the system, and we can get things working
again by just restarting the target follower. In general with ROS we
have the choice to run nodes in separate processes, which allows for
such fault tolerance, or run them together in a single process, which
can provide higher performance (and of course we can mix and match the
two approaches).</li>
<li><strong>Language independence</strong>: It can happen that our blob finder expert
writes their computer vision code in C++, while our target follower
expert is dedicated to Python. We can accommodate those preferences
easily by just running those nodes in separate processes. In ROS, it is
perfectly reasonable, and in fact quite common, to mix and match the use
of languages in this way.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="beyond-topics-services-actions-and-parameters"><a class="header" href="#beyond-topics-services-actions-and-parameters">Beyond Topics: Services, Actions, and Parameters</a></h2>
<p>Most ROS data flows over topics, which we introduced in the previous
sections. Topics are best for streaming data, which includes a lot of
the common use cases in robotics. For example, going back to our
ball-chasing robot, most cameras will naturally produces a stream of
images at some rate, say, 30Hz. So it makes sense for the camera driver
to publish the ROS messages containing those images just as soon as
they're received. Then the blob finder will be receiving image messages
at 30Hz, so it might as well publish its ball location messages at the
same rate, and so on, through the target follower to the motor driver.
We might say that such a systems is <em>clocked from the camera</em>: the data
rate of the primary sensor, the camera in this case, drives the rate of
computation of the system, with each node reacting in to receipt of
messages published via topics by other nodes. This approach is fairly
common and is appropriate for systems like our ball-chasing robot. There
is no reason to do any work until you have a new camera image, and once
you have one you want to process it as quickly as possible and then
command an appropriate steering direction in response.</p>
<p>(We are making various simplifying assumptions, including that there is
sufficient computational capacity to run all the nodes fast enough to
keep up with the camera's data rate; that we do not have a way to predict
where the ball is going in between camera frames; and that the motors
can be commanded at the same rate the camera produces images.)</p>
<h3 id="services"><a class="header" href="#services">Services</a></h3>
<p>So topics get the job done for the basic ball-chasing robot. But now say
that we want to add the ability to periodically capture an
ultra-high-resolution image. The camera can do it, but it requires
interrupting the usual image stream that we rely on for the application,
so we only want it to happen on demand. This kind of interaction is a
poor fit for the publish-subscribe pattern of a topic. Fortunately, ROS
also offers a request-reply pattern in a second concept: <em>services</em>.</p>
<p>A ROS service is a form of remote procedure call (RPC), a common concept
in distributed systems. Calling a ROS service is similar to calling a
normal function in a library via a code API. But because the call may be
dispatched to another process or even another machine on the network,
there is more to it than just copying pointers around. Specifically, a
ROS service is implemented using a pair of ROS messages: a <em>request</em> and
a <em>reply</em>. The node calling the service populates the request message
and sends it to the node implementing the service, where the request is
processed, resulting in a reply message that is sent back.</p>
<p>We might implement the new high-res snapshot capability like so:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Define a new service type.</strong> Because services are less widely used than
topics, there are relatively few &quot;standard&quot; service types predefined.
In our case, the new service's request message might include the desired
resolution of the snapshot. The request message could be a standard
<code>sensor_msgs/Image</code>.</li>
<li><strong>Implement the service.</strong> In the camera driver, we would
advertise the newly defined service so that when a request is
received, the usual image-handling is interrupted temporarily to allow
the device interaction necessary to grab one high-res snapshot, which is
then packed into a reply message and sent back to the node that called
the service.</li>
<li><strong>Call the service.</strong> In the target follower node, we might add a
timer so that every 5 minutes, it calls the new service. The target
follower would receive the high-res snapshot in response to each call,
and could then, say, add it to a photo gallery on disk.</li>
</ul>
<p>In general, if you have a need for infrequent, on-demand interactions
among nodes, ROS services are a good choice.</p>
<h3 id="actions"><a class="header" href="#actions">Actions</a></h3>
<p>Sometimes, when building robot control systems, there is a need for an
interaction that looks like request-reply, but that can require a lot of
time between the request and the reply. Imagine that we want to wrap up
our ball-chasing control system into a black box that can be invoked as
part of a larger system that makes the robot play football. In this
case, the higher level football controller will periodically want to
say, &quot;please chase the red ball until you have it right in front of
you.&quot; Once the ball is in front of the robot, the football controller
wants to stop the ball-chasing controller and invoke the ball-catching
controller.</p>
<p>We <em>could</em> achieve this kind of interaction with a ROS service. We could
define a chase-ball service and implement it in the target follower.
Then the football controller could call that service when it wants the
ball chased. But ball-chasing may take quite some time to complete, and
it may fail to complete. Unfortunately, after calling the chase-ball
service, the football controller is stuck waiting for the reply, similar
to the situation in which you call a long-running function in code. The
football controller does not know how well (or poorly) the chase is
going, and it cannot stop the chase.</p>
<p>For such goal-oriented, time-extended tasks, ROS offers a third concept
that is similar to services but more capable: <em>actions</em>. A ROS action is
defined by three ROS messages: a goal, a result, and feedback. The goal,
sent once by the node calling the action to initiate the interaction,
indicates what the action is trying to achieve; for ball-chasing it
might be the minimum required distance to the ball. The result, sent
once by the node implementing the action after the action is complete,
indicates what happened; for ball-chasing it might be final distance to
the ball after the chase. The feedback, sent periodically by the node
implementing the action until it is complete, updates the caller on how
things are going; for ball-chasing it might be the current distance to
the ball during the chase. In addition, actions are cancelable, so the
football controller can decide to give up and move onto another tactic
if the chase is taking too long or if the feedback messages are showing
that there is little chance of success.</p>
<p>In general, if you want to support on-demand, long-running behaviors, ROS
actions are a good choice.</p>
<h3 id="parameters"><a class="header" href="#parameters">Parameters</a></h3>
<p>Any nontrivial system requires configuration, and ROS is no exception.
When we start our robot's motor driver node, how do we tell it to
connect to the motors via <code>/dev/ttyUSB1</code>? We do not want to hard-code
that information into the node, because on the next robot it might be
<code>/dev/ttyUSB0</code> instead. ROS addresses such configuration needs via a
fourth concept: <em>parameters</em>. A ROS parameter is what you might expect:
a named, typed, place to store a piece of data. For example, the motor
driver node may define a parameter called <code>serial_port</code> with type
string. When it starts up, the node would use the value of that
parameter to know which device to open to get to the motor system.</p>
<p>ROS parameters can be set in a few ways:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Defaults.</strong> A ROS node that uses a parameter must embed in its code
some default value for that parameter. In the case that nothing else
in the system sets the parameter value explicitly, the node needs some
value to work with.</li>
<li><strong>Command-line.</strong> There is standard syntax for setting parameter
values on the command-line when launching a node. Values set in this
manner override defaults in the code.</li>
<li><strong>Launch files.</strong> When launching nodes via the <code>launch</code> tool instead
of manually via the command-line, you can set parameter values in the
launch file. Values set in this manner override defaults in the code.</li>
<li><strong>Service calls.</strong> ROS parameters are dynamically reconfigurable via a
standard ROS service interface, allowing them to be changed on the
fly, if the node hosting the parameters allows it. Values set in this
manner override whatever previous values were set.</li>
</ul>
<p>For most nodes, parameter management is relatively simple: define a
handful of parameters, each with a reasonable default; retrieve the
parameters' values at startup, which accounts for changes made via
command-line or launch file, then begin execution and disallow future
changes. This pattern makes sense for the motor driver, which needs to
know which <code>/dev/ttyUSB</code> device file to open at startup, and does not
support changing that setting later. But there are cases that require
more sophisticated handling. For example, the blob finder node may
expose as parameters a variety of thresholds or other settings that
configure how it identifies the red ball in images. These kinds of
settings can be changed on the fly, which the target follower might want
to do, based on how well the chase is going. In this case the blob
finder needs to be sure to use the latest values for its parameters,
knowing that they may have been changed by another node.</p>
<p>In general, when you want to store stable, but possibly changeable,
configuration information in a node, ROS parameters are a good choice.</p>
<h2 id="asynchrony-in-code-callbacks"><a class="header" href="#asynchrony-in-code-callbacks">Asynchrony in Code: Callbacks</a></h2>
<p>Throughout ROS, you will see a common pattern in the code, which is the
use of <em>callback functions</em>, or simply <em>callbacks</em>. For example, when
subscribing to a topic, you supply a callback, which is a function that
will be invoked each time your node receives a message on that topic.
Similarly, when you advertise a service, you supply a callback that is
invoked when the service is called. The same goes for actions (for
handling of goals, results, and feedback) and parameters (for handling
of setting new values).</p>
<p>Programming with callbacks is not familiar to everyone. It differs from the
standard sequential presentation of programming, in which you write a <code>main()</code>
function that does A, then B, then C, and so on. By contrast, in ROS (and in
most systems that focus on data-processing and/or control), we follow an
event-based pattern. In this pattern, we do A whenever X happens, B whenever Y
happens, and so on.</p>
<p>A common structure for a ROS node is the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Get parameter values.</strong> Retrieve the node's configuration,
considering defaults and what may have been passed in from outside.</li>
<li><strong>Configure.</strong> Do whatever is necessary to configure the node, like
establish connections to hardware devices.</li>
<li><strong>Set up ROS interfaces.</strong> Advertise topics, services, and/or actions,
and subscribe to services. Each of these steps supplies a callback
function that is registered by ROS for later invocation.</li>
<li><strong>Spin.</strong> Now that everything is configured and ready to go, hand
control over to ROS. As messages flow in and out, ROS will invoke the
callbacks you registered.</li>
</ul>
<p>Following this structure, a <code>main()</code> function in a ROS node is often very
short: initialize and configure everything, then call a spin function to let
ROS take over. When you are trying to understand what is happening in a ROS
node, look in the callbacks; that is where the real work is happening.</p>
