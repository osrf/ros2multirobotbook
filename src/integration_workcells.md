## Workcells

Currently RMF has 2 types of sample workcells, namely: `Dispenser` and `Ingestor`.

| Message Types | ROS2 Topic | Description |
|---------------|------------|-------------|
| `rmf_dispenser_msgs/DispenserRequest` | `/dispenser_reqeusts` | Direct requests subscribed by the dispenser node |
| `rmf_dispenser_msgs/DispenserResult` | `/dispenser_results` |  Result of a dispenser request, published by the dispenser  |
| `rmf_dispenser_msgs/DispenserState` | `/dispenser_states` |  State of the dispenser published by the dispenser periodically |
| `rmf_ingestor_msgs/IngestorRequest` | `/ingestor_requests` |  Direct requests subscribed by the ingestor node |
| `rmf_ingestor_msgs/IngestorResult` | `/ingestor_results` |  Result of a ingestor request, published by the ingestor |
| `rmf_ingestor_msgs/IngestorState` | `/ingestor_states` |  State of the dispenser published by the ingestor periodically |

In `rmf_demos` world, both `TeleportDispenser` and `TeleportIngestor` 
[plugins](https://github.com/open-rmf/rmf_simulation/tree/main/rmf_robot_sim_gz_plugins/src) act as workcell adapter nodes.

Workcells currently work alongside with Delivery Task. In `fleet_adapter.lauch.xml`,
`perform_deliveries` needs to be `true` for the robot to accept a delivery task. 

A Full Delivery:
1) The robot will first move to the `pickup_waypoint`
2) Requests a `DispenserRequest` till receives a `DispenserResult`. (Done Dispensing)
3) Continue delivery and moves to `dropoff_waypoint`
4) Requests a `IngestorRequest` till receives a `IngestorResult`. (Done Ingesting)
