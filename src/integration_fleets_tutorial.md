# Fleet Adapter Tutorial

`fleet_adapter` acts as a bridge between the robots and the core RMF system.

Its responsibilities include but are not limited to:

- Updating the traffic schedule with the fleet robot's positions

- Responding to tasks

- Controlling the vendor robots.

The `fleet_adapter` receives information (position, current ongoing tasks, battery levels etc.) about each robot in the fleet and sends them to the core RMF system for task planning and scheduling.

- When the core RMF system has a task to dispatch, it communicates with the various fleet adapters to check which fleet is suitable for taking this task.

- It sends a request, to which fleet adapters respond by submitting their fleet robots' availability and statuses.

- RMF determines the best fleet for the task and responds to the winning bid, i.e. the fleet that is selected. The response contains navigation commands relevant to the delegated task.

- The fleet adapter will then send the navigation commands to the robot in appropriate API.
